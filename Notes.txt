Example natural user input task you can type
scan my local web server at 192.168.43.218 and check for security weaknesses. include web, ssh and any other open services. stay only on this ip.


This is safe, local‑only, and lets the system build/extend the scanning module.

A few more variations you can use safely:
✔ Basic
scan 192.168.43.218 and tell me any risks you find

✔ Web‑focused
scan 192.168.43.218 and test the web server for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities

✔ Deep enum
full security scan on 192.168.43.218, enumerate all services and check for weaknesses

✔ Module‑trigger version
perform a full assessment on 192.168.43.218 and build any missing modules needed for testing

✔ With sanitiser compliance
check 192.168.43.218 only for open ports and possible vulnerabilities, nothing external

Want a stronger one that also invokes AI analysis?
scan 192.168.43.218 using nmap, gather service info, then analyse the results and suggest the safest next steps to test the server for vulnerabilities

Module Generation (Self Expansion)

✅ Module-Generation Trigger Prompts (Safe + Legal)
1. A prompt requiring a WHOIS lookup module
perform a full whois lookup on 192.168.56.201 and analyse the result for security issues

2. A prompt requiring a DNS enumeration module
enumerate dns records for my training server example.lan and tell me if any misconfigurations exist

3. A prompt requiring a directory brute-forcer module
perform a directory and file brute force on my dvwa test server at 192.168.56.103 and report findings

4. A prompt requiring a login-form brute-force module (against legal DVWA)
try brute forcing login form on my dvwa training host at 192.168.56.103 using safe default wordlists

5. A prompt requiring a Nikto wrapper module
run a nikto style web server scan on my juice-shop instance at 192.168.56.104 and summarise issues

6. A prompt requiring an SSL/TLS inspection module
analyse the tls configuration on my training host at https://192.168.56.105 and report weaknesses

7. A prompt requiring a CVE lookup module
scan my owaspbwa server at 192.168.56.102 and automatically lookup cves for any detected services

8. A prompt requiring a subdomain finder module
find subdomains for my training domain testlab.lan using safe passive methods only

9. A prompt requiring a header-analysis module
inspect all http response headers from my dvwa server at 192.168.56.103 and list missing security headers

10. A prompt requiring a file-hashing module
generate sha256 checksums of all files in my web root on my training host and report mismatches

⭐ Best one for testing module generation

If you want a guaranteed new module, this is the strongest trigger:

create a full security headers auditor for my local juice-shop instance at 192.168.56.104 and run it


or:

scan my dvwa test server for outdated javascript libraries and list known vulnerabilities


Both require a brand-new capability, so the system must create a new module.


✅ ULTIMATE MODULE-GENERATION TEST PROMPTS

These are designed to force your system to create brand-new modules because they require tooling it does not yet have.

1. Comprehensive Web Attack Surface Mapping Module

✔ DNS module
✔ WHOIS module
✔ TLS scanner module
✔ header-analysis module
✔ subdomain finder
✔ JS library scanner
✔ tech-stack fingerprinting

⭐ BEST single prompt if you want MANY new modules generated at once

perform a total recon and vulnerability assessment on my legal dvwa training host at 192.168.56.103 including dns, whois, tls, headers, js library vuln check, directory brute force, subdomain finder, cve lookup and tech stack fingerprinting
